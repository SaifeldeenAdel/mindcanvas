					Introduction
				</h2>
				<p className="text-justify text-[1.1rem] font-light sm:text-[1.3rem]">
					If you've heard of Claude Monet, you've probably seen paintings of his
					infamous water lillies. They are not the main focus of this post as
					countless people already talked about them and I wouldn't be doing it
					enough justice. This post, however, is about Monet's love for water
					more generally. And moreso, my love for Monet's work involving water.
				</p>
				<br />
				<br />

				<h2 className="pb-4 font-sans text-[1.2rem] font-semibold sm:text-[1.5rem]">
					Water, what's so special
				</h2>

				<p className="text-justify text-[1.1rem] font-light sm:text-[1.3rem]">
					Recently, I was going through Monet's pieces and the ones that kept
					catching my eye were ones that involved bodies of water, his
					seascapes. They are calm, vibrant, and extremely intricate. It is
					genuinely fascinating how he makes colors work together in this way. I
					also quite enjoy the visible brush strokes on some of these, they
					create some sort of texture that works really well with water.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p className="text-justify text-[1.1rem] font-light sm:text-[1.3rem]">
					These textures were usually created by him allowing the paint to dry
					then superimposing more layers and brushstrokes creating a rough
					texture that usually depicted waves, rocks, etc. And other times where
					he didn't even wait and painted over wet paint which I assume is what
					created some of his seamless blends between the blues of the water and
					the oranges and reds of the sunlight.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p className="text-justify text-[1.1rem] font-light sm:text-[1.3rem]">
					Monet was one of the first artists in the impressionist movement.
					Impressionism, in short, being the art form that involves capturing
					colorful moments, usually outdoors, with no specific subject in mind.
					Water is perfect for that. Take something that is always in motion and
					paint what it looks like in a single moment, deciding on reflections
					and shades that are infinitely unique.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p className="text-justify text-[1.1rem] font-light sm:text-[1.3rem]">
					I chose Monet's water work because it is something I personally liked.
					I admire the rest of his work however this is the subset I found
					myself actually going back to look at again.
