        <p className="paragraph">First of all, what even is self-reflection and why do you need to do it?</p>
        <p className="paragraph">Self-reflection is taking the time to analyse and interpret your thoughts, emotions, actions, and many more things your ‘self’ may experience on a daily basis. It is what builds self-awareness and self-awareness is what helps us avoid being on autopilot, experiencing life and its stresses the same way every-day. </p>

        <p className="paragraph">The idea of sitting down with your thoughts may seem scary to most people and that’s what makes this practice even more necessary to do in my opinion, as constantly avoiding unpleasant thoughts will only lead to a miserable life. Putting in some effort to understand why these thoughts arise, and what lead to them in the first place will help you actually formulate ways to deal with them rather than miserably suppressing them all the time. </p>

        <h2 className="font-montserrat font-semibold text-[1.5rem] pt-8 pb-4">Alright how do you do it..</h2>
        <p className="paragraph">For me there are two main ways by which one may self-reflect:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 paragraph">
          <li><span className="font-semibold">Written</span>  - Journalling</li>
          <li>Thought excerise - Meditation</li>
        </ul>
